Law School (2021),2021,South Korea,"When a grim incident occurs at their prestigious school, justice through law is put to the test by a tough law professor and his ambitious students.

Yang Jong Hoon is a criminal law professor and a former elite prosecutor, whose harsh words make him the professor to steer clear of.  At the same time, there’s something compelling about his strict teaching methods and his refusal to accept less than the best from his future juniors in the legal profession.

Han Joon Hwi, a first-year law student, is at the top of his class. He’s a natural leader whose good looks and easy charm make him the perfect man - on paper. However, there’s an unexpected side to him that remains well-hidden. 

Kang Sol (A) is another first-year law student who overcame childhood poverty and hardships by gaining special admission to the school. She walks a path of thorns due to her constant sense of deprivation and shame amidst the wealth and talent that surrounds her. Eventually, her passion will enlighten her on what it truly takes to be a good lawyer.

Kim Eun Sook is a civil law professor who was once the head of the law school’s free legal clinic. Her natural air of authority and freewheeling personality earned her the reputation for being a master in court.

(2) Yu Jin Oh owned a bar in his previous life. In 2017, he is a talented ghostwriter who can bail Se Joo out of his predicament, but the mysterious man has a condition for his services. Se Joo may not be able to meet it.

(3) Jeon Seol was a sniper. Now she has extremely varied expertise. She is a former Olympian hopeful, a veterinarian, and a book lover who runs her own delivery service. She oscillates between extreme fandom and anti-fandom of Se Joo.

Love in Contract (2022),2022,South Korea,"Undeniably attractive, talented, and charming, Choi Sang Eun is the living definition of the perfect partner. This is exactly why instead of marrying, she chooses to employ her skills as a contract marriage master. Transforming herself into the perfect partner for each of her clients, Sang Eun allows those who employ her services to live the perfect single life, without having to agree to a committed, life-long relationship. 

A long-term client, Jung Ji Ho has been using Sang Eun’s services every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, for the past five years. A man shrouded in mystery, Sang Eun knows virtually nothing about Ji Ho but that doesn’t stop her from developing some rather unexpected feelings for him. Making her life even more difficult are the equally unexpected feelings she’s recently developed for one of her newest clients, Kang Hae Jin. A popular actor who employs her services on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, Hae Jin often makes Sang Eun’s heart flutter.

Torn between her professional obligations and the feelings she harbors for both Ji Ho and Hae Jin, Sang Eun finds herself in an unexpected predicament. How can she possibly maintain her professionalism when her heart is leading her in two different directions?

With Florida Banjeom, a popular Chinese restaurant, comfortably settled up on the roof, people from far and wide are always running in and out of the building.

Through the Darkness (2022),2022,South Korea,"Back in the 1990s, the citizens of Seoul were gripped with a paralyzing fear after a series of brutal attacks and murders occurred. A mysterious figure dubbed ‘Red Cap’ was stalking women on the streets then killing his prey, seemingly without provocation. His habit of striking at random made it impossible for the detectives to predict his next move. At the top of their minds is what could be triggering him. 

Aware of the American F.B.I. and its successful use of criminal profilers to identify serial killers, the head of the Criminal Behavioral Analysis team, Gook Young Soo recruits Song Ha Young, a quiet, reserved, incredibly perceptive former detective for his team. Gook believes using this new psychological method will give the police an edge in capturing 'Red Cap' and ending his killing spree. 

Homicide expert Yoon Tae Goo and her officers question the value of this approach and are resistant to entering such uncharted territory. To quell their scorn they need to convince that this radical crime-fighting approach will increase their arrest rates. Does Song Ha Young have the ability to gain the trust of callous criminals while seeing through them? Is he clever enough to outwit them?  But more importantly, does he possess the emotional fortitude to withstand the process?

 A legend among his peers, Do Jung Woo is the leader of one of the National Police Agency’s special task forces. While his outward appearance likens him more to an unruly child than a legendary officer, his keen insight and quick wit make him more than capable of solving any crime. After reports of numerous mysterious incidents begin to filter in, Jung Woo springs into action. But this isn’t a mystery he’s allowed to solve on his own. Working alongside Jung Woo, Officer Gong Hye Won refuses to let anything stand between her and what she wants.

 Tenacious and hot-tempered, she’s determined to solve every case, by any means necessary, and this case is no exception. Joined by Jamie, a detective on loan from the FBI, Jung Woo and Hye Won set out to unravel the present mysteries of this small village. But they soon realize that the incidents of the present tie strongly to those of the past. Will this team of experts be able to solve a case nearly thirty years in the making?

HIStory3: Make Our Days Count (2019),2019,Taiwan,"At first glance, high schoolers Xiang Hao Ting and Yu Xi Gu appear to be polar opposites: While Xiang Hao Ting is an outgoing, hot-headed extrovert and some-time bully, Yu Xi Gu prefers to keep a low profile and focus on his schoolwork. They seem bound for totally different futures – the bookish Yu Xi Gu looks destined for academic success, while life is just a long popularity contest for Xiang Hao Ting. But a quirk of fate – and a crucial intervention by a female schoolmate – results in the two young men’s paths crossing.

However, there is more to both young men than first meets the eye. Xiang Hao Ting was not always this way. He started out as a perfect student until he discovered the joys of going off the rails. And Yu Xi Gu has a reason for being so aloof and studious: His parents died in a traffic accident while he was younger, and he is being fostered by his aunt. As such, he works hard to get good grades in an effort to win a scholarship and ease the financial burden on his relatives. Yu Xi Gu also works part-time at a convenience store, where his manager Liu Zhi Gang has developed a crush on a man he has met at the gym. Back at school, meanwhile, Yu Xi Gu and Xiang Hao Ting find themselves drawn together, and passions ignite. The former notices that he has the unique ability to bring Yu Xi Gu out of his shell – and becomes intent on melting his cold-as-ice exterior.

What will happen when their two worlds collide? And can love be the catalyst that helps bring these two unlikely students together – as their high school days draw to a close?

Five years ago, Shen Yi, who was still a student, was sketching on the street. A woman brought a picture of a child and asked him to draw what the child would look like as an adult. However, this painting caused Haicheng detective Lei Yi Fei to be exposed as an undercover agent, and he was killed.  Lei Yi Fei happened to be Du Cheng's long-time friend and confidant.

In order to find out the truth, Shen Yi accepted the invitation of Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau and became a portraitist of the Interpol Team.

However, in several collaborations, Shen Yi has repeatedly cracked the ""dead end"" of cases with his ""three-year-old painting,"" ""drawing based on audio,"" ""micro-color discrimination,"" and other stunts, which slowly started to impress Du Cheng. More importantly, the truth of Lei Yi Fei's death is still buried in Shen Yi's memory.

Then, Ji Yoon’s career comes to a crashing halt when grad student Han Sang Hyun publicly challenges the authenticity of the Mount Geumgang painting, and Ji Yoon does not adequately defend Jung Hak’s reputation.

An enraged Jung Hak has Ji Yoon fired and ostracized from the art history community. At the bottom of her life, Ji Yoon discovers the secret diary of Shin Saimdang (1504-1551), a Korean artist, writer, calligraphist, and poet who was the mother of Yi I, one of the two most prominent Korean Confucian scholars during the Joseon Dynasty. 

The diary sheds new light on the life of Saimdang, her relationship with painter Lee Gyeom, and the Mount Geumgang painting.  With the help of Sang Hyun and her best friend, Go Hye Jung, an antiquities researcher, can Ji Yoon get her life and career back?

Kimi wa Petto (2017),2017,Japan,"29-year-old Iwaya Sumire has had a bad day. Make that the worst of all bad days. She has been dumped by her boyfriend of 5 years when she was anticipating a marriage proposal (although she read the situation and dumped him before he could get the words out) and has been demoted from the foreign correspondence department to a different department at the newspaper where she works because she punched her boss when he made drunken advances. Stumbling home, drunk, and emotionally wrung out, Sumire remembers that a puppy had been set out for adoption in a box near her apartment building that morning. Hoping that the puppy is still there, she opens the box flaps only to find a young man with a lithe, graceful body, large, dark eyes, and a mop of shaggy dark hair staring back at her. 

In her drunken stupor, Sumire mistakes the young man, 20-year-old modern interpretive dancer Goda Takeshi as her favorite dog Momo from when she was a child. Goda Takeshi is practically homeless, and at the moment is slightly injured from having been beaten up by an assailant for reasons unknown when he climbed into the box to both hide and catch some sleep. Sumire clings to him, weeping. Compassionate to a fault, Takeshi's heart softens for this strange woman and he brings her safely to her home where she kisses him in the entryway, still crying. He was wrecked from that moment. So begins a bizarre and beautiful relationship where Sumire allows Takeshi to live with her, but solely in the capacity of a pet dog. She even calls him Momo. Every day, coming home, Sumire-chan (as Takeshi calls her) and ""Momo"" do life together in such a way that gradually develops into so much more.

Mental Coach Jegal (2022),2022,South Korea,"A sports drama about a former national athlete who quits sports after causing a scandal and becomes a mental coach to help former professional athletes who have retired and current athletes who have fallen into a slump.

Je Gal Gil is a former national Taekwondo athlete who is known for his hard work and dorky charms.

But the turbulent times took a heavy toll on Princess Jung Myung. Upon the death of King Seon Jo, Gwang Hae ascended the throne and his first order of business was to eliminate Prince Yeong Chang and banish Queen In Mok from the palace. Then his next target was Princess Jung Myung. When In Mok learned that her daughter’s life was in danger, she sent her into hiding. But assassins tracked Jung Myung down. Through the heroic sacrifice of her bodyguard, Jung Myung was put on a boat that sailed adrift in the sea. Meanwhile, the bodyguard and nanny set their boat ablaze and died to fool the assassins. Jung Myung witnessed her nanny and bodyguard consumed by the flames. Adrift on the boat, Jung Myung lost consciousness and was picked up by a merchant boat crossing to Dejima in Japan. She was sold as a slave. 
To survive in the hostile environment she hid the fact that she was a princess. She also vanquished her memories of ever being a princess so that she could focus on how to get revenge. Posing as a boy, Jung Myung worked as a laborer in the sulfur mine. But she discovered hope in the depths of her despair. It was a friendship between Ja Gyung that helped her cling to life. But she never lost her focus on returning to Joseon one day and bringing the downfall of Gwang Hae who had taken everything away from her. Then an opportunity arose. She began peddling information and secrets in the sulfur mines. Leveraging her strategic location, she followed the Joseon delegation visiting Japan back to Joseon. Finally, her dream to return to Joseon had come true…

Unkind Women (2015),2015,South Korea,"The drama is about four women spanning three generations in one household, who share the same hot-blooded temperament.

Thirty years ago, when her husband passed away in an accident, Kang Sunok raised her teenage daughters alone.

Rewriting Destiny (2022),2022,China,"Xia Yu Bing is a minor and somewhat unpleasant and malevolent character in a universe – set in Ancient China – dreamed up by a comic book author. She dies early in the “story,” after being poisoned by her husband Xu Zi Yan. But after she is killed, the author confronts her in a sort of comic book afterlife space and tells her that she will have the chance to be re-spawned. Furthermore, she learns, if she plays her cards right, she will be able to become the “female lead” and a “good” character in the story.

She comes back to “life,” but finds that becoming a “goodie” isn’t an easy task. Xu Zi Yan is still determined to wipe her out and conduct ghastly experiments on her body. And on top of it all, a number of other “characters” in the story now have it in for her – including female characters who also want to be the main heroine. A number of other minor characters also block her way or plot her downfall. But as she spends more time with Xu Zi Yan – all the while trying to avoid his plans to destroy her – an unlikely bond begins to form between them. Will Cupid become her ally in Xia Yu Bing’s bid to become the ultimate female lead?

In pursuit of this, they develop three suits of power armor, called Rider Gear (Delta, Faiz, and Kaixa), to find and protect the Orphnoch King, who can fix a defect within Orphnoch DNA which causes their genetic structure to break down, leading to death.
The Rider Gears are stolen by Hanagata, the Goat Orphnoch and former chief of Smart Brain. He sends them to his foster children (dubbed the Ryuseiji, after the school they attended) so they can stop the Orphnoch from achieving their goal. However, Rider Gears were designed to be worn by Orphnoch, and humans are unable to activate the systems without undergoing genetic modification.
A young loner, Takumi Inui, is unwittingly drawn into the conflict between the Orphnoch and humans and becomes Kamen Rider Faiz to save the life of Mari Sonoda, one of the Ryuseiji. The Smart Brain begins targeting him in an attempt to retrieve the Faiz Gear.
However, there is division amongst the Orphnoch, as those who wish to co-exist with humans rather than kill them, begin resisting the Smart Brain, who in turn targets them as well. Most of these ""renegade"" Orphnochs are either killed, remain neutral or begin siding with the Ryuseiji against the Smart Brain.
When the Tokyo police discover the Orphnoch are behind a series of bizarre murders, they begin operations to defeat the creatures, largely unaware of the various factions involved. They even begin performing experiments on captured Orphnoch in an attempt to find ways of destroying them, though this does not go well.
The Orphnoch King eventually awakens within a young boy named Teruo Suzuki, whom Naoya Kaido and Keitaro Kikuchi saved and befriended. Now, it is up to the holders of the Rider Gears to band together and fight for humanity's survival.

Delayed Justice (2020),2020,South Korea,"Park Tae Yong and Park Sam Soo fight for judicial victims who are falsely accused.

Park Tae Yong, a public defender, was born as the son of an undertaker on an island. He did not take the typical route to become a lawyer. After graduating from high school, he did not go to a university. He later passed the bar exam and became a lawyer. He is full of justice and has empathy for others. He will defend all kinds of petty offenders. A turning point occurs in his legal career when he becomes the first attorney to win a general criminal retrial case.

Park Sam Soo is a reporter. After he graduated from the university, he worked as a non-permanent employee. Thanks to his excellent writing skills, he became a reporter. He looks for stories which are ignored or passed over by other reporters. He is soft-hearted and easily moved to tears. Though his work does not bring him financial stability, his writings are able to deeply move the hearts of readers, some of whom volunteer their own resources and skills to support his journalism. 

Working with Sam Soo is Lee Yoo Kyung, who, despite a silver-spoon upbringing, is a brave, justice-seeking rookie whose first scoop is Tae Yong's victorious retrial case. Seeing Tae Yong's courtroom performance, Yoo Kyung is, like Sam Soo, struck by his passion, empathy, and drive to bring justice to the victim.
