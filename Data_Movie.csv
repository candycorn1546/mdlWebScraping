Like the music streaming from the radio, their frequencies slowly come in sync; even when they're apart, the show brings them together through ebbs and flows of events arising from both pure coincidence and inevitability, until the bitter reality drives them apart.

In 1997, during the IMF crisis, two people meet while exchanging stories on a radio program. They fall in love, but can't quite seem to get the timing right.

The film is a romantic melodrama that will tell the love story of the optimistic Hyun Woo and the hard-working Mi Soo,  who end up meeting by chance. Although the young couple’s paths keep crossing, the timing never appears to be in their favor.

Joint Security Area (2000),South Korea,"Nothing is more symbolic of the division of Korea into two countries as the 'Bridge of No Return' in Panmunjom, the demilitarized zone on the border between the two states. One day, a border guard is killed by a rifle bullet; the suspected marksman is a South Korean soldier, who is found wounded in the middle of no-man's-land. This incident will have grave repercussions. Both North and South Korea regard the incident as an act of deliberate provocation. The North accuses the South of having committed a 'terrorist attack', whilst South Korea suspects the North of having attempted an 'abduction'. Both sides appeal to the authorities of the neutral states (NNSC) for help and ask them to investigate the affair.
A female Swiss army captain of Korean descent is then sent to Panmunjom to investigate the death of the North Korean border guard, apparently shot in the line of duty by a South Korean guard. At first, neither army officers from the South nor communist officials from the North will cooperate - until it is obvious to all that the truth must come out to defuse a potentially explosive international incident.

Although things have got off to a decidedly shaky start for Ki Jin and Yeong Woo, they start to develop a fondness for one another and start to wonder if their seemingly opposing blend of determinedness and acceptance could be a case of “opposites attract.” But when a leading model named Lee Bin arrives on the scene, things get complicated. He starts to develop a crush on Ki Jin. Could this development spell the end for the fledgling romance between Ki Jin and Yeong Woo?

One day, the director of the movie calls and says he wants to buy the old reel of film. The owner of the theater agrees to sell it, despite Kenji’s protests. “This will be the last showing…” But then something miraculous happens. Following a clap of thunder, the heroine of the movie literally jumps off the screen… in black and white! She’s breathtakingly beautiful and equally strong-willed, just like Princess Miyuki in the film!

From the get-go, Young Bin is not exactly a class act.
On the opposite side of the spectrum is the beautiful Han Mi, a meek university student looking for true love, but never seem to find it. As is typical in this kind of film, the two meet purely by chance: Han Mi accidentally texts messages Young Bin before literally bumping into him. Han Mi, feeling that their fortuitous meeting is a sign that they might be destined for one another, decides to go around with Young Bin and see if there's any chemistry between them. Taken by Han Mi's sincerity and her willingness to pick up the check, Young Bin jumps at the opportunity.
But Han Mi's cousin, Chae Young isn't quite so enraptured with Young Bin and tries to dissuade Han Mi from pursuing him. The thing is, Chae Young is a professional dating consultant and a strong subscriber to blood type theory. According to her, any relationship between the mismatched duo would be doomed to failure because Young Bin is a type-B male, which supposedly makes him arrogant, hardheaded, and generally a jerk, whereas Han Mi is a type-A female, one who supposedly can't help being timid and obedient. But, while Chae Young predicts impending doom, the happy couple try to give love a shot, ignoring their supposed blood type incompatibility. But will they succeed?

Punch (2011),South Korea,"Wan Deuk is a high school boy who lives with his hunchback father and has the unfortunate luck of having his high school homeroom teacher as his neighbor. Despite his dad’s diminutive size, Wan Deuk considers him to be the greatest man he knows. Wan Deuk has all the makings of a troublemaker: he gets bad grades and comes from a poor, underprivileged family. But when it comes to fighting, he has never lost about. With no hopes, dreams, and nothing to offer, there’s only one thing in this world that Wan Deuk prays for—the day that he can get rid of his homeroom teacher, neighbor, and incessant meddler Dong Ju. Wan Deuk can’t seem to get away from him; stuck with the man all day at school and beckoned to him at all hours of the night at home. As he does any other day, Wan Deuk stops by the neighborhood church and prays desperately for God to kill Dong Ju.
Dong Ju is a one-of-a-kind high school educator whose pupils have cleverly nicknamed “Dung-Zoo.” He doesn’t feel the need to wake up sleeping students in study hall and only profanity seems to come out of his mouth. For some reason, he shows boundless interest in Wandeukyi, which tends to result in humiliation for the boy. Dong Ju exposes details of Wan Deuk’s family life to his classmates and even takes the food that Wan Deuk receives as government aid. Having Dong Ju barge in at night to drink with Wan Deuk’s father and uncle is nothing new for the poor boy. Then one day, Dong Ju meddles with his life by insisting that he meet his mother—a woman whose existence he himself had not known about. At his wit’s end, Wan Deuk even tries to run away from home. Unfortunately, it’s impossible for him to escape the ever-growing interest Dong Ju has in him.

Kingdom 2: To the Far Land (2022),Japan,"After suppressing the rebellion of his younger brother, the King of the State of Qin, Ei Sei, who had taken the throne and is aiming to unify China, is threatened by assassins who entered the royal palace one night. Thanks to Shin and Ka Ryo Ten, who rushed to the scene, the assassins were successfully repelled, but it was clear that there was someone inside the palace who was plotting to assassinate Ei Sei. While there was still some uncertainty, the neighboring enemy, the State of Wei, began to invade across the border, and Shin is finally to join his first battle as a foot soldier.

The foot soldiers formed a five-man ""GO"" team, and Shin joined the battlefield together with his old friends Bi Hei and Bi Tou, who come from the same hometown, the experienced squad leader Taku Kei, who is unreliable but had never killed anyone, and the mysterious Kyou Kai, whose face is almost entirely covered with a mask.

This scrappy 26-year old, orphaned and separated from her older sister when she was still a child, has fought her way up the food chain to become the leader of her own gang. Known in mob circles as Mantis, her skills in hand-to-hand and weapons combat are unsurpassed, and anyone who crosses her can expect a beating, her own men included. Having grown up in such a male-dominated and violence-prone environment, Eun Jin has adopted a tomboy lifestyle, walking, talking, and dressing like a man.

However, this is all turned upside-down when Eun Jin finally is reunited with her long-lost sister. Unfortunately, she is dying from cancer and asks a favour of Eun Jin: to get married and settle down. So what does the legendary gang leader do? She sends out her men to find a husband for her, as quickly as possible. Of course, this is easier said than done. 
Though they hire a professional to give Eun Jin a makeover and give her dating lessons, this ends up backfiring as she keeps lapsing back into gangster mode. 

Finally, Eun Jin settles on Kang Su Il, a civil servant who has no idea what is going on most of the time. Seeing Su Il as the quickest way to fulfil her sister's dying wish, Eun Jin gets hitched, which is when the fun really begins, as she tries to play housewife to the clueless Su Il while continuing to run her gangland operations. Unfortunately, matters are complicated as the leader of a rival gang tries to muscle in on Eun Jin's territory. And if that wasn't enough, the dying sister makes one more request: for Eun Jin to become a mother.

His warlord father gave the originals to 48 demons in exchange for power. When Hyakkimaru kills a demon, he wins back a body part.
He is spotted in one of these battles, with a giant spider demon, by Dororo, a scrappy female thief who is fascinated by not only Hyakkimaru's prowess with the sword blade poking out of his arm but the new leg he grows after dicing his opponent. Is he a man - or a monster? After hearing his story from an old minstrel, she decides to join him on his travels and find out for herself.
Dororo dresses, talks and swaggers like a guy, but she obviously has more than a matey interest in this strange, fearsome but good-looking bionic warrior. It is an interest that she hides with a bluster that makes the grim-visaged Hyakkimaru smile. What really bonds them, however, are their various battles with demons. Dororo proves herself a fearless ally - if one inclined to get into trouble at awkward moments. But Hyakkimaru decides he must go it alone when he finally encounters his most relentless enemy, his own father. Meanwhile, Dororo realizes that her pal is the son of the man who killed her father and left her an orphan. Is this end of a beautiful friendship?

Ju-on: The Curse (2000),Japan,"""Ju-On: The Curse"" is comprised of six vignettes. Each one centers around a different character, but the timeline between episodes is not always chronological. There is always some kind of connection between them, however, and this makes the film work on a deeper level. It's not quite as common-sense as ""Momento,"" but that only adds to the replay value. 

The first episode, ""Toshio,"" will be recognizable to those who have seen ""The Grudge."" It tells the story of a teacher who visits the home of a little boy who has been absent from school. While there, he discovers that the house may be haunted. While the American remake has very little interaction between this teacher and other characters, ""The Curse,""in one of the most difficult scenes to watch, displays a disturbing connection between him and another, surprising, person. 

Other vignettes revolve around the house and those who live or visit there. Some are similar to scenes in the remake while others, such as a scene revolving around a character who is terrified of cats, will seem unusual to some Westerners unfamiliar with Japanese superstitions (And speaking of our feline-fearing friend, if you thought the first couple of minutes in the attic during ""The Grudge"" were scary, wait until you see this expanded version of the intro scene. It's worse. Much worse.). 

The main difference between this film and ""The Grudge"" is one of quality: ""Ju-On: The Curse"" was shot directly on video. It is filmed as if it were a theatrical release (meaning there's no jumpy ""Blair Witch"" action here), but the stark quality of the images makes it more visceral and accessible than any other of the other films in the series. The sharp camera work adds a voyeuristic quality that only adds to the creepiness of the film.

Before I could take in what happened, the Guardian grabbed me by my collar, forcing me to listen to him explain about the prize that a stray spirit like me was given. I was sent to live again in the body of a high school teenager named Min, who was lying dead in the morgue in this hospital. In fact, living in a new body is no different to living in a homestay. It’s temporary and not for free. Within 100 days, I have to find out “who is responsible for Min’s death”. If I fail, I will die and leave this homestay for eternity.

Actually, I didn’t think I would enjoy living in this homestay this much. Having a new family and new friends doesn’t make my heart beat as fast as when I met Pie, Min’s tutoring peer. She is the one who makes me want to extend my stay in this body forever. But, just like time, life and love seem like prizes from heaven that are given to me only temporarily, I have to do whatever it takes to find the answer to the Guardian’s question before my time in this homestay runs out.
